    <h3>Finger Lickin' Good!</h3>
    <p>We all like Fried Chicken! It is literally the most accessible food known to man; evidenced
        by the fact that nearly every culture has itâ€™s own version of this dish. The poultry or breading
        may change, but the fact of the matter is, it is all fried chicken at the end of the day.

    <p>Honestly, you and I both know that you will enjoy this dish. You wouldn't be here if you did not
        want to make it. Who hasn't heard of fried chicken by now? C'mon man!
